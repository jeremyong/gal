# About

This is a passion project in an endeavor to provide a GA library that is as usable and practical as it is instructional. A huge shoutout to Steven De Keninck ([his blog](https://enkimute.github.io/)) for his input and feedback during GAL's development. 

GAL is in its infancy, but if you've found a use for it or would like to contribute, please do contact me. I'd love to hear from you. Feel free to shoot me a pm on the [bivector.net](https://discourse.bivector.net) forums [here](https://discourse.bivector.net/u/ninepoints).
