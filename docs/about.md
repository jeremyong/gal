# About

This is a passion project in an endeavor to provide a GA library that is as usable and practical as it is instructional. A huge shoutout to Steven De Keninck ([his blog](https://enkimute.github.io/)) for his input and feedback during GAL's development, particularly on the mathematical foundations of GA as the GAL author (me) was a newer practitioner during its initial implementation phases. GAL is young but has already undergone 3 rewrites to get to its current stage, owing largely to how tricky it has been to get an implementation that was suitably fast not just at runtime, but also at compile time.

GAL is in its infancy, but if you've found a use for it or would like to contribute, please do contact me. I'd love to hear from you. Feel free to shoot me a pm on the [bivector.net](https://discourse.bivector.net) forums [here](https://discourse.bivector.net/u/ninepoints). Alternatively, feel free to leave a comment below!
